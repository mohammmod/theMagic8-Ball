# theMagic8-Ball
The Magic 8-Ball app is a Thymeleaf Web application that will display the random messages of the famous 8-Ball on a simple HTML5 page when a get request arrives to the “/” url. Refreshing the page will make it display another random message from a list of them that can be hardcoded in the Controller.
